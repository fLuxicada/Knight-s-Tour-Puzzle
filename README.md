Play the classic Knight's Tour Puzzle or ask the computer to find a solution for you.

The puzzle is customizable - you are free to choose the board dimensions and starting position (IMPORTANT: not every board size + starting position has a solution).

First, choose the board dimensions. Input them as two numbers separated by space, where the first number represents the number of columns, and the second the number of rows.

Next, choose the starting position on the board. The puzzle follows a cartesian coordinate system, where the leftmost bottom square corresponds to 1 1. Input the position as two numbers separated by space.

Finally, choose whether you want to try the puzzle yourself or see the solution. The program will then check to see whether a solution exists. If one doesn't, it will tell you so. If one does, it will execute according to your choice.

Playing the puzzle:
Input the next move following the same structure as the starting position.
The current position is marked with X, while the visited squares are marked with *. From your current position you will be able to preview your next possible moves. The numbers represent how many future moves are possible from that position.

ENJOY!
